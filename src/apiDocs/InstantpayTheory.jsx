      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-200">1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        InstantPay is a real-time digital payment system designed to transfer
        funds instantly between users, banks, or digital wallets. It eliminates
        delays seen in traditional payment methods by offering immediate
        processing, making it suitable for personal, commercial, and online
        transactions. InstantPay provides a seamless experience where money is
        transferred within seconds, ensuring convenience and efficiency for
        users who require quick financial movement.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-200">2. How It Works</h2>
      <p>
        InstantPay operates by validating user details, authenticating the
        sender, and communicating directly with the bank or payment network to
        process transactions instantly. When a user initiates a payment, the
        system verifies the account information and ensures that sufficient
        balance is available. After successful authentication, the payment
        request is sent to the banking network, which debits the sender’s
        account and credits the receiver’s account in real time. Both sides
        receive confirmation messages immediately, completing the transaction
        smoothly and reliably.
      </p>

        for every transaction, maintaining transparency and reliability.
