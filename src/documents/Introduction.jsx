          FlowPipe is a unified service platform designed to simplify and
          centralize multiple verification, payment, and automation workflows.
          Instead of integrating with several individual providers, FlowPipe
          gives you a single API that connects everything—from PAN and Aadhaar
          verification to payments, BBPS, payouts, collections, and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          This guide helps you understand how FlowPipe works, what it offers,
          and how you can seamlessly add it to your applications with minimal
          effort. The goal is to make your onboarding smooth, predictable, and
          enjoyable.
